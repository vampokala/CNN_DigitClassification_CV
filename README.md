## Introduction

This notebook covers the following key points:
- An introduction to the MNIST Dataset and its importance in Computer Vision.
- Building a baseline classification model using a CNN.
- Evaluating the CNN model.
- Improving the initial CNN model.
- Finalizing the improved model for prediction on the test dataset.

## MNIST Dataset

The **MNIST** dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a collection of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. The task is to classify these images into one of the 10 digits (0-9).

MNIST is widely regarded as the "Hello World" of computer vision, serving as a benchmark for evaluating various machine learning and deep learning models.

## Building a Baseline CNN Model

In this section, we build a simple CNN model using the Sequential API from Keras. This model serves as a baseline to compare with more complex models later.

### Key Concepts:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Keras Sequential API
- Layers in CNN (Convolutional, Pooling, Dense)

### Resources:
- [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
- [Keras Sequential API Documentation](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/)

## Evaluating the CNN Model

We evaluate the baseline model using metrics like accuracy and loss, and visualize the performance using graphs.

### Key Concepts:
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss)
- Visualization of model performance

- [Model Evaluation Metrics in Deep Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-machine-learning-algorithm-f10ba6e38234)

## Improving the CNN Model

To improve the initial CNN model, we may use techniques such as:
- Adding more layers or neurons.
- Using different types of layers (e.g., Dropout for regularization).
- Optimizing hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size).

### Key Concepts:
- Model optimization techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning

- [Dropout Regularization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-for-regularizing-deep-neural-networks/)

## Final Model and Predictions

In this section, we finalize the improved model and use it to make predictions on the test dataset.

### Key Concepts:
- Final model evaluation
- Making predictions
